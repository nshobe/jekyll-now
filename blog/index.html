	    <p>If you actually <i>clicked</i> on a blog link, this day in age, I'm sorry. If for some reason
	    you haven't closed your browser window yet, the following will hopefully be a <i>somewhat</i> up
	      to date listing of the blog articles I've posted. You might find it easier to navigate using
          tags which will take you to posts with the relevant subject matter. Cheers.</p>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <article class="post">

      <h1><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        {{ post.excerpt }}
      </div>

      <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}" class="read-more">Read More</a>

  {% endfor %}
  <p>This is the end. Go away. You probably have friends you're neglecting. Take them to the movies.</p>
