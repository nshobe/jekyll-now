## The secret code
Well, actually the point is to keep it from being secret. Everyone forgets things, especially those that program anything. We say "good code is easy to read and understand" then about 2 minutes later say "what was I doing here?".

## What I code
Mostly bash, a touch of python when I have to, and other languages as needed when forced. I'm fairly proficient at puppet, but I don't think it's fair to call that a programming language, as it's merely a declaritive language with only rudimentary iteration and function capability.

## Why I code
Because I'm lazy enough to figure out how to avoid repition when it's painful. I don't exactly code for fun, but I enjoy taking time here and there to figure something out and expand my skill set.

Have a comment? Message me on github or other means. I don't hide.
